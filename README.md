**makespec** is a set of rules and templates to manage specifications written
in [Pandoc Markdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html).
It consists of a Makefile that generates human-readable documentation (HTML,
PDF...) and schema files (OWL, Turtle, Relax-NG, BNF...) from a common source
file. The Makefile also supports generating and updating [GitHub
pages](http://pages.github.com/) to publish the specification at GitHub.  Feel
free to reuse, [comment](https://github.com/jakobib/makespec/issues), fork, and
modify makesec! The current version can be found at
<https://github.com/jakobib/makespec>.
